I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Automating Job Post Savings with Selenium

## Project Overview
Today, I worked on a project aimed at automating the job application process on LinkedIn using Selenium. The initial goal was to create a script that could automatically apply for jobs based on predefined criteria. However, I personally would not to apply blindly without reviewing each listing. Therefore, I adjusted the focus of this project to automate the task of saving job postings instead. This approach ensures that I don't inundate recruiters with irrelevant resumes while testing my project.

## What I Learned
- __Web Scraping with Selenium:__ I honed my skills in using Selenium for web scraping. This involved navigating a webpage, locating elements using various strategies (such as XPaths, CSS Selectors, and class names), and performing actions like clicking buttons.
  
- __Element Interaction:__ I learned to handle various types of web elements and interact with them programmatically. This included dealing with dynamic elements that require waiting for them to become interactable.
  
- __Error Handling in Automation:__ I incorporated error handling to manage scenarios where certain elements might not be present on the page, ensuring the script can handle such cases gracefully.
  
- __Using Environment Variables:__ For security purposes, I used environment variables to manage sensitive information like login credentials, keeping them out of the source code.
  
- __Practical Application of WebDriverWait:__ Implemented WebDriverWait to ensure elements were fully loaded and ready for interaction before attempting to interact with them, making the script more robust and reliable.

Here is a sample demo:

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the process of web automation using Selenium. While the initial objective was to automate job applications, the current implementation focuses on saving job postings, which I find more practical and useful for my needs. This experience has furthered my understanding of automation and its applications in real-world scenarios.
